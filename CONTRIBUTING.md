# Contributing Guidelines

Simple steps to make contributing to this project as smooth as possible:

- Read, understand, and abide by our [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](https://github.com/SethMichaelLarson/trytravis/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Make sure to add all changes you make to [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/SethMichaelLarson/trytravis/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) under the correct heading.
- Test your changes before submitting a Pull Request by running `tox` in the project root.
  Or alternatively use `trytravis` for what it was made to do! ;)
- Be patient with maintainers, we have jobs and lives outside of Open Source.
  We'll get to your issues and Pull Requests when we can. :)
