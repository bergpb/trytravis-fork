Send local git changes to Travis CI without commits or pushes.

## About

I developed this tool because debugging Travis has plagued me many times, so many that
I decided that creating this tool would save me a ton of time in the long run.
I know this tool is effective [because I eat my own dog-food](https://github.com/SethMichaelLarson/trytravis-target).
This tool has become a part of my standard every-day git workflow.

[Check out `trytravis` in action in this `asciicast`](https://asciinema.org/a/135389)

Maybe it can save you some time too! Do you meet any of these criteria:

- Have you ever spent hours committing tiny changes, pushing, waiting for a specific job over and over again?
- Do your Pull Requests have 5 times as many commits as there are meaningful changes simply due to CI issues?
- Are you tired of complicated and obscure `git` commands in order to roll-back and delete useless commits from your history?

If any of these sound like you, `trytravis` is the tool for you.

## Installation and Usage

Here's a short guide on how to get started. If you've got questions or need
a clarification on any steps don't hesitate to open an issue. (Or one better,
open a Pull Request to fix the problem for others!)

### Supported Platforms

`trytravis` works on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS and only requires
Python 2.7 or Python 3.4 or later to be installed to run.

### Install the latest `trytravis` via [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):
```
bash-4.4$ pip install trytravis
bash-4.4$ trytravis --version
trytravis 1.0.0 (ubuntu 16.04.3 python 3.6.2)
```

### Optional: [Create a new GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/).

You can create a new GitHub account to allow for higher utilization of Travis
builds so your `trytravis` builds don't conflict with regular builds.
Make sure to also register the account with Travis.

You can use your own GitHub account if you want as well.

### [Create a GitHub repository](https://github.com/new)

Here's a [guide on how to create a GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/).
Don't use an organization account as the owner of the repository.
Use the same account that you used to create this repository for the next step.

**IMPORTANT:** The name of the repository should contain `trytravis`. This is a feature
that prevents users from accidentally pushing to a repository that they didn't intend to
use as a target repository.

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you don't use a repository where you have things you
don't want to be changed. This tool will make major changes to the repository.

### Setup Authentication for the GitHub Repository

You should setup your git so that you can push to this repository without
entering your username and password each time.

I highly recommend using SSH and register your SSH keys with GitHub. Check out
[this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)
for help setting this up for easy pushing to repositories. You must use a URL of `ssh://git@github.com/[USERNAME]/[REPOSITORY]`
in order to use SSH authentication.

If you can't use SSH authentication you can [potentially use credential caching](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28562679/5763213).

### [Register the repository with Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/)

Login to Travis, go to Accounts and turn the building on for the Repository. You
may need to use `Sync Account` if you don't see the repository in the available list.

### Tell `trytravis` which GitHub repository to use

Run `trytravis --repo` and enter in the URL to the repository that you just created.
You can use `ssh://git@github.com/[USERNAME]/[PROJECT]` or
`https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[PROJECT]` as the URL for the repository.

### Get your access token to Travis API:

Install travis package: `gem install travis`,
And run this command: `travis login && travis token`
Insert your github credentials and copy your token from command line.
```
Username: your_github_user
Password for : your_github_password
Successfully logged in as your_github_user!
Your access token is your_access_token`
```

### Tell `trytravis` which token to use:

Run `trytravis --token` and just paste your generated token.

### Ready to Use the Tool

Move to the base directory of your project and execute the following command:

  ```
  $ trytravis
  ```

After this if `trytravis` is able to detect your GitHub repository and local changes
you should see the following output from this command:

```
Adding a temporary remote to `https://github.com/SethMichaelLarson/throwaway`...
Adding all local changes...
Commiting local changes...
Pushing to `trytravis` remote...
Reverting to old state...
Waiting for a Travis build to appear for `d443d2e985812bd693e61e7093985a8e9451fad4f`...
Travis build id: `268589271`
Travis build URL: `https://travis-ci.org/SethMichaelLarson/throwaway/builds/268589271`

### Upgrading to the Latest Version

If you haven't upgraded lately I recommend running the following
command to upgrade to the latest version of the tool:

`pip install -U trytravis`

### Additional Recommended Steps

#### Large communities should encourage contributors to use `trytravis`

This will save the very few builder-hours that the project has available from pointless
debugging and excessive commits. Makes sure that builder time is spent effectively by
only running builds that are expected to pass.

#### Setup your Travis to automatically cancel builds

Travis has this option per-repo to cancel old builds if there are new pushes to the same branch.
This feature can be enabled by going into the repository settings and turning
`Auto cancel branch builds` to `ON`.

#### Modify your `.travis.yml` file to target only the jobs you need

This will reduce the amount of time it takes to build the set of
jobs that you need while you're debugging an issue and because your
changes don't get committed to your main branch you don't need to worry
about removing commits you can simply `git revert .travis.yml` when
you're finished debugging.

### Troubleshooting

#### The push occurs correctly but my build isn't appearing in Travis?

Do you have `branches: only: ...` defined in your `.travis.yml` file?
Unless you're working in one of the branches allowed by Travis this will probably make `trytravis`
timeout on waiting for a Travis build to start with the correct commit. (Because there won't be one!)

The suggested solution that I have used is to locally edit your `.travis.yml` file to allow
that branch to be built and revert once you're done debugging before committing.

## Future Improvements

- Ideally would like to create a complete Travis interface in the command line to allow
  easy usage and tracking of Travis builds from the command line.
- Stream output of Travis from the command line.
